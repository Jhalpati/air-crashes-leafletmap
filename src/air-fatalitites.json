Selfridge, 26, who was a passenger. This was the first recorded airplane fatality in history.  One of two propellers separated in flight, tearing loose the wires bracing the rudder and causing the loss of control of the aircraft.  Orville Wright suffered broken ribs, pelvis and a leg.  Selfridge suffered a crushed skull and died a short time later."

    "Summary": "The aircraft lost an engine about 45 minutes into the flight. As the plane was incapable of maintaining level flight with only one engine operating, the pilot decided to make an emergency landing. He asked the mechanic to ask two passengers to move towards the rear of the aircraft. This instruction was apparently misunderstood by the passengers, as four of them moved towards the rear of the aircraft. This affected the center of gravity of the aircraft, which then entered into a spin and crashed."

After encountering fog and poor visibility, the plane was diverted to Kirksville where witnesses reported the low flying aircraft made contact with the ground and crashed. Whether the plane struck the ground while the pilot was attempting to make an emergency landing or because the available fuel supply had been exhausted, or for other reasons, could not be determined. New Mexico Senator Bronson M. Cutting, 46, killed. Improper clearance of the airplane from Albuquerque by the company's ground personnel when the plane's two-way radio was not functioning properly."
